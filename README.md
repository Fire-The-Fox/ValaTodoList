# ValaTodoList
Simple Todo List app written in Vala

## Why?
I always wanted to try Vala and it was not the best experience. I was getting stuck in loopholes when looking at the docs that have few or 0 explanation what what does

GNOME devs ‚ù§Ô∏èüëç

From my perspective, Vala is easy to use but hard to learn and missing documentation is really something that is annoying

## Issues
providing too many thing that needs to be done resolves in very tall window

### Issues not reallated to project by Vala on my system
the compiler says to use G_APPLICATION_DEFAULT_FLAGS ( GLib.ApplicationFlags.DEFAULT_FLAGS ) even docs says so, but the vala says it doesn't exist
