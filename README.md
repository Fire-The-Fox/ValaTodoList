# ValaTodoList
Simple Todo List app written in Vala

## Why?
I always wanted to try Vala and it was not the best experience. I was getting stuck in loopholes when looking at the docs that have few or 0 explanation what what does

GNOME devs ‚ù§Ô∏èüëç

From my perspective, Vala is easy to use but hard to learn and missing documentation is really something that is annoying

## Issues
providing too many thing that needs to be done resolves in very tall window
